UPDATE ClanSphere 2008.X to ClanSphere 2009.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Create a backup of your modified and added files

2. Save the contents of the database, for example in MySQL with the tool phpMyAdmin
   Note: The built-in export in ClanSphere is currently only suitable for small amounts of data

3. Make sure a login.htm exists in the template to open the page in maintenance mode
   Caution: If it doesn't exist please copy from the one within the clansphere template including CSS files

4. Set the mode of the page to maintenance, which can be found inside System -> Options -> ClanSphere

5. Go to System -> Database -> Import and run the files from the updates directory
   Caution: Do only execute files from your current version up to the current one
   Note: In older versions ClanSphere the database module can have another name

6. Unzip the contents except for the directories docs and updates, first locally and then on the webspace
   Note: At best use a FTP program e.g. FileZilla

7. Remove the existing logs directory when it is not used for Logs like e.g. the Apache webserver
   Note: If unsure the previous log directory can be found inside the index.php file and is defined in the array $cs_logs
   Note: Future logs are automatically stored into the uploads/logs directory, so you need to change its CHMOD

8. Remove the files publish.php and counter.php from the directory system/runstartup
   Remove the files and lang.php content.php from the directory system/core

9. Make sure that all settings are correct in the CMS and view the error logs for problems
   Note: You can disable the maintenance mode from now on and the update is finished
