UPDATE ClanSphere 2009.0.3 to ClanSphere 2010.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Attention: ClanSphere 2010 requires 2009.0.3 or newer to be installed on SQL-side.
All shipped files with this release must replace their old counterparts on your webspace, too.

The following steps inform you about changes that may need your attention in order to keep 
ClanSphere running after the update process is finished. Please read them carefully.

1. The directory /system/runstartup does no longer exist by default and is no longer needed, 
   because startup files moved to the corresponding mods directory. To restore the old and 
   obsolete behavior you have to delete the switched files and add this to your setup.php file:
     $cs_main['runstartup'] = 1;

2. Your template files should not contain code in languages like e.g. CSS or JavaScript. Such 
   parts are better separated from HTML and loaded with a <link> tag in the source code. This 
   will result in big performance gains, but also prevent strange errors from occuring.
   
3. ClanSphere does no longer ship with Mootools included. Be sure to use jQuery Syntax instead 
   as it is the only JavaScript Library bundled with upcoming releases. We have also moved all 
   JavaScript includes to the very bottom of the HTML body tag by default so that DOM parsing is 
   only done once which speeds up page generation in every web-browser.
